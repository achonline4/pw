##### rustc - rust cool or rust compiler :)

Rust compiler enumerates every single error it throws and you can find more details about those using the compiler itself.
Following is a snapshot of error mismatched types and the second last line tells you how you can find more details about it.

![](./readmeimages/b.png)

And following is what that explanation looks like - 

![](readmeimages/a.png)

Random

Mutability

    `let var;
    var =  10;`

    This is an assignment, therefore the compiler allows the variable to be modified, but
    only one time.

Scope

    use std::io; io::stdin()

    std::io::stdon()

    Both of the above ways are identical in Rust, they have no difference when it comes
    to binary size or any other build aspect.
    Unlike in C++, where using a namespace brings all its symbols into scope which
    essentially increases the binary size regardless if all the symbols are being used or
    not.
